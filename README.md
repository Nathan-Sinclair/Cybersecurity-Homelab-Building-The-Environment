# Cybersecurity-Homelab-Building-The-Environment
## Purpose:
Built a small-scale cybersecurity lab simulating a business network to enable hands-on testing, SIEM configuration, and attack/defense simulations, serving as the foundation for follow-up projects.  

## Implementation:
- Built a cybersecurity lab with Active Directory domain controller, servers, and Windows/Linux workstations.
- Configured VMs (VirtualBox/VMware) with NAT networking and enterprise-style IPs.
- Deployed Windows Server 2025, Windows 11, Ubuntu Desktop/Server, integrating Wazuh, Security Onion, Postfix and MailHog.
- Set up the network with SIEM functionality, EDR, and vulnerability scanning.
- Documented setup with screenshots and configuration examples for reproducibility.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- **Virtualization & Lab Setup**: Configured multiple VMs in VirtualBox/VMware with NAT networking, snapshots, and cloning.  
- **OS Administration**: Installed and managed Windows Server 2025, Windows 11, and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.  
- **Active Directory & Identity Management**: Managed users, groups, SSO, and domain-joined workstations.  
- **Network & Security Configuration**: Assigned static IPs, configured jumpboxes, and implemented SIEM/EDR with Wazuh.  
- **Containerization & Services**: Deployed Docker containers (MailHog) and used Docker Compose for repeatable setups.  
- **Email Simulation & Automation**: Set up MailHog SMTP, sent test emails via Python, and created email polling scripts.  
- **Log & Threat Monitoring**: Collected and analyzed logs from Windows and Linux endpoints for intrusion detection.  
- **Scripting & Automation**: Wrote Bash and Python scripts to automate lab tasks and monitoring.  
- **Documentation & Reproducibility**: Produced step-by-step guides with screenshots for lab replication.  
- **Problem Solving**: Troubleshot VM networking, agent deployment, container setup, and domain integration issues.

|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hypervisor (VirtualBox)  | Runs and manages multiple virtual machines on the Windows host.          |
| Enterprise Workstation 1 | Simulates a Windows 11 employee workstation.                            |
| Enterprise Workstation 2 | Simulates a Linux workstation, e.g. developer environment.               |
| Security Workstation     | Used for monitoring and analyzing attacks with Security Onion.           |
| Security Server 1        | Provides isolated email environment with MailHog for phishing exercises.|
| Security Server 2        | Acts as central SIEM/EDR server with Wazuh for log collection/analysis. |
| Directory Services Server| Provides Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, and SSO for identity management.   |
