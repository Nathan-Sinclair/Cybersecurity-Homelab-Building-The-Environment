# Cybersecurity-Homelab-Building-The-Environment
## Purpose:
Built a small-scale cybersecurity lab simulating a business network to enable hands-on testing, SIEM configuration, and attack/defense simulations, serving as the foundation for follow-up projects.  

## Implementation:
- Built a cybersecurity lab with Active Directory domain controllers, servers, and Windows/Linux workstations.
- Configured VMs (VirtualBox/VMware) with NAT networking and enterprise-style IPs.
- Deployed Windows Server 2025, Windows 11, Ubuntu Desktop/Server, integrating Wazuh, Security Onion, Postfix and MailHog.
- Set up the network with SIEM functionality, EDR, and vulnerability scanning.
- Documented setup with screenshots and configuration examples for reproducibility.
